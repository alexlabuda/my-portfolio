      description: "This dashboard helps Marketing & R&D Teams determine gaps in customer spend. Under the hood, it uses machine learning to predict spend and compare it to actual spend. Data is wrangled to create  RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features to help predict the probability of a purchase, and the amount ($) each customer is likely to spend. Marketing teams can then use this to target customers that were predicted to spend but did not, or customers that are likely to spend even more than they already have."
